In doing this I had to work with many different operating systems, mainly desktop Windows operating systems and some server systems, I had to have an understanding of
their vulnerabilities and weaknesses in order to keep them maintained and secure. I also assisted the team in moving and upgrading the servers within the School to include more automation and monitoring through the Remote Desktops that were set up to be connected to by students.</p>
